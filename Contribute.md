We welcome and appreciate contributions from the community! This document outlines how to contribute to XandAI.

1. Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

## 2. Branching Strategy üå≥
We use a Gitflow-inspired branching strategy:

   main Branch: This branch always reflects the production-ready code.  Do not commit directly to main.
   develop Branch: This branch integrates features and is used for ongoing development.
   Feature Branches:  For each contribution, create a new feature branch from develop.  Name your branch descriptively (e.g., feature/add-new-functionality, fix/bug-in-module-x).

<code class="inline-code">main</code> Branch: This branch always reflects the production-ready code. Do not commit directly to <code class="inline-code">main</code>.*
<code class="inline-code">develop</code> Branch: This branch integrates features and is used for ongoing development.
Feature Branches: For each contribution, create a new feature branch from <code class="inline-code">develop</code>. Name your branch descriptively (e.g., <code class="inline-code">feature/add-new-functionality</code>, <code class="inline-code">fix/bug-in-module-x</code>).</code></pre>main Branch: This branch always reflects the production-ready code.
